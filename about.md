title: About Me
---

Hi there! I am Mojtaba Barzegari, a passionate postdoctoral researcher in computational engineering. From scientific computing to high-performance computing and computational chemical / biomedical engineering - I love finding novel ways to put computers at work on real-life problems. I am particularly comfortable with multi-disciplinary endeavors in mathematics, physics, computer science, engineering disciplines (chemical / biomedical / mechanical), chemistry, life sciences (medical- or bio-science) and materials science.

Currently, I work as a Marie Sklodowska-Curie Individual Postdoctoral Fellow in the Electrochemical Materials and Processes group at Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e), where I model electrochemical processes of energy storage / conversion systems. Prior to that, I was a PhD researcher at KU Leuven, Belgium, doing high-performance computational modeling on biomechanics and tissue engineering processes. I earned my BSc and MSc in materials science and biomedical engineering, respectively, both of which focused the combination of numerical analysis and computational intelligence. Moreover, I have worked on Machine Learning and data analysis projects in medicine, biology, industrial automation, and internet of things (IoT). For a comprehensive overview of my research experiences,  please refer to my [Research Portfolio](/research).

But wait, there’s more! Since 2003 I have been involved in building software for just over 21 years now and that has included projects from IoT & embedded systems to large-scale enterprise applications. I am a huge fan of the open-source software development model, and in scientific computing specifically I'm firmly on the side of open-source and open-science. Just look at the <a target="_blank" href="http://tuxriders.com/">TuxRiders</a> project for a good  example.

To gain further insight into my background, feel free to peruse my [CV](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mbarzegary/MyCV-shortened/blob/main/main.pdf). The source code of my CV is available on [this repository](https://github.com/mbarzegary/MyCV-shortened), granting you the chance to create your own if you like its format. (An outdated less-compact version is available [here](https://github.com/mbarzegary/MyCV).)

Outside of science, I play bass and electric guitar poorly in order to sound vaguely pleasant to the ear. I am a keen chess player, and famous chess players are my celebrities so I enjoy watching / following them a lot. And let's not forget my love for chatting with people - whether it's discussing the mysteries of the universe or debating the best recipe for a specific food, I'm happy to talk about what's on everybody's mind.
